            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Now were our hopes at the height, and we could ſcarce containe our ſelues for ioy. But how ſoone was it daſht, for what became of all the inuincible Armado, but confuſion to it ſelfe, ſhame and loſſe to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb facs="tcp:14366:3"/> and ſuch griefe to the Pope that procured it, as coſt him his life: and we were left not like <hi>Sheepe</hi> to the ſlaughter (for we loue not the ſheepes qualities) but like <hi>Foxes</hi> to be hunted by the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes and ferretted out of all our warme neſts.</p>
            <p>Thus laden with ſhame and ſorrowes, we lay languiſhing in woe and miſery, hauing now no hope left but the death of that wicked woman, for which wee ſaid many a maſſe, made many a praier, and (becauſe you know we truſt not to our praiers) deuiſed many a treaſon againſt her life, but all in vaine, ſhee liued to ſee the hanging of hundreds of vs, and died at laſt with nothing but old age, ſurmounting in glory and greatneſſe, all the Princes in the world of her ſexe and time.</p>
            <p>And now had we beene vtterly forlorne, and deſperate, had it not beene that ſome good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes put vs in hope to finde fauour from him that did ſucceed her. This kept vs in life, and and therefore at his entrance, wee went with the foremoſt, and let the world ſee our hopes were not dead. But alas alas for vs poore curſed caitiffes, wee lept out of the Frying-panne into the fire, for preſently we found our ſelues in worſe caſe vnder him and farre more hopeleſſe then before.</p>
            <p>Wherevpon ſome of our zealous brethren, <note place="margin">

               </note> ſeeing how they and wee were deceiued, plotted againſt him, and hoped to haue conſtrained him to that they deſired, but all in vaine, for this was defeated and they were hanged, and wee poore
<pb facs="tcp:14366:4"/> Catholikes left cold and comfortleſſe. Oh had wee then beene ſo wiſe as to haue gone all to <hi>Rome,</hi> how happie had wee beene, but wee were yet put into one hope more by our ghoſtly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and confeſſors, that at the next Parliament wee ſhould bee relieued: for the good ſucceſſe whereof wee all praied and longed to ſee that happy day: and indeed a number of our braueſt ſpirits and moſt zealous Catholikes had attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one of the worthieſt exploits that euer the world heard of, and the blow was euen almoſt giuen, ſentence was pronounced vpon the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes of <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe confirmed by all the Ieſuited Catholikes in the world, and executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was expected within a few houres: But alas alas (as ſome of thoſe good men ſaid when they were <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Grant</hi> and <hi>Keyes.</hi>
               </note> in the Tower) the buſineſſe was too good to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, for all was diſcouered and we defeated, and ſo in ſtead of them, wee gaue our ſelues the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt blow that euer we had, and of which, whilſt the world ſtands we ſhall neuer bee cured: for by this action many of our chiefe ones loſt their liues, wee our peace, and our religion that little credit it had afore amongſt them, &amp; all we got was this that his Holineſſe leaſt we ſhould be all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from ſuch braue workes, made them <note place="margin">As was the powdet trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note>

            <p>And thus good Catholikes if we will not cozen our ſelues, ſay in earneſt, where are we now? and
<pb facs="tcp:14366:4"/> what is become of all our hopes? are they not all like <hi>Tabacconiſts</hi> food, and the <hi>Alehimiſts</hi> riches blowne away in ſmooke? And as our hopes are paſt and worne away, ſo if we conſider the preſent perſecutions &amp; miſeries we endure, it is more then marueilous we ſtay in in <hi>England,</hi> you know how bitter the lawes are againſt vs, and the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee ſeeth his mercy is abuſed, commands them all to be executed vpon vs, ſo that now to offer to bribe the <hi>Purſiuants</hi> and corrupt the <hi>Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> will doe vs little good, hee is ſo ſet againſt vs and tranſported with zeale to his owne religion (which He good ſoule thinkes verily to bee the true Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus) as now all the gold we can keepe from <hi>Rome</hi> will ſcarce purchaſe vs a protector, or finde one that dare once open his mouth to ſpeake a word for vs.</p>
            <p>Oh then (deere Catholikes) what doe wee here, what ſtay we for? what can you hope or looke for here? but for a heauier yoke, and more grieuous perſecution euery day? why then doe we not get vs all to <hi>Rome,</hi> out of the ſtormy and tempeſtuous <hi>England</hi> into the happy hauen and ſweete ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine of his holineſſe fauours? where ſhould the <hi>Children</hi> be but with their father? where the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants</hi> waite, but on their Lord? where the <hi>Sheepe</hi> feede but with their Shepheard? where can you drinke ſo pure as at the <hi>Fountaine?</hi> where graze ſo daintily as vpon the <hi>Seauen hills?</hi> where ſucke ſo ſweetely as at your <hi>Mothers teats?</hi> Is not his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> your father, and the holy <hi>Roman Church</hi>

And for her (moſt louing mother that ſhe is) ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer receiued more then came to her, nor deceiued any that truſted her not: her lappe was euer open to receiue, and her treaſure to disbuſe againe, but marke the difference and magnifie her boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for ſhe takes from you but your ſiluer or gold or ſuch like temporall traſh, but opens you her treaſure, and lades you againe with better bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, ſpirituall riches, holy pictures bleſſed graines, <hi>Agnus deis,</hi> holy bones, holy ſtones, holy wood, holy bloud, holy relikes, holy ragges: glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious pardons, gratious Indulgences, and other inualuable Iewells: and well may I call them ſo, for no liuing man can tell the value of them: leaue then theſe Heretikes, who (groſſe heads) know not the vertue of theſe riches, leaue them I ſay to their Onions and Garlike, their word and Sacraments, their Pſalmes and Sermons, their praying and preaching, like Dogs to their cruſts, or Swine to their akornes.

            <p>Oh then what a worthy change ſhall you make, <hi>Italy</hi> for <hi>England: Rome</hi> for <hi>London, Tiber</hi> for <hi>Thames, Maſse</hi> bookes for <hi>Bibles,</hi> ſeauen <hi>Sacraments</hi> for two, and many other great bleſſings to boote: you ſhall be deliuered from Sermons, and Pſalmes ſinging, and Praiers in a knowne tongue, and many other ſuch ſuperſtitious ceremonies, which heere you are combred withall: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as here you can ſcarce walke in <hi>Pauls,</hi> nor make a bargaine in the <hi>Temple Church,</hi> without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offended with Pſalmes ſinging, Bells ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſerue hereticall deuotions, nor walke ſcarce by any Church, but ſhall bee ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and tormented with a Sermon. There you ſhall bee quite deliuered from all ſuch purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and contrariwiſe you ſhall not peepe into a Church, nor creepe into a Cloiſter where you ſhall not finde more bounties and bleſſings, and more thouſands yeares of pardon, then all the Churches of <hi>England</hi> are able to giue; as you ſhall well perceiue by this enſuing Booke: And if you haue ſuch queſie and tender ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes as you cannot bee without a Sermon, his
<pb facs="tcp:14366:6"/> Holineſſe herein alſo condiſcends to your infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and prouides, therefore you ſhall haue ſtore of them in <hi>Lent,</hi> when like <hi>Fiſh</hi> they be in the beſt ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>And if the feare of Purgatory happe to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you, <hi>Rome</hi> is the onely place in the world for you, for you will perceiue by this booke ſo many fine and eaſie waies to eſcape it, as you will hold him more then worthy to goe to hell, that euer ſuffers himſelfe or any hee loues to come within the ſent or ſmoake of purgatory.</p>
            <p>And for your Clergy and confeſſors, and young men vnmaried feare not, they will be in better plight then they euer were in <hi>England,</hi> for the ſtewes are there in euery ſtreete which his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (out of his owne former experience, no doubt of the neceſſity thereof) in great wiſdome tollerats both for Clergy and Layetie, for eſchew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of greater inconueniences but eſpetially that his Clergie may auoide that fowle and deteſtable ſinne of mariage: which with vs is held a greater <note place="margin">Coſterus in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chirid. Gret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecus, Ignatius &amp;c.</note> ſinne then to lie with other mens wiues, or twenty whores. And if any thing doe afterward trouble the conſcience, you haue there at euery houre a Confeſſor at hand, and are not to ſeeke him a farre off, ſend for him with coſt, keepe him with danger, and ſend him away in ſecret as you doe in <hi>England:</hi> and he is as readie to giue you abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as you to pay him, and as able to diſcharge you of all your ſinnes as of his owne.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:14366:6"/>
            <p>And as for worldly wants, feare them not, how can ſo tender a father, and ſo louing a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee their children want? who knowes not the rich and royall entertainment that <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> had, when hauing loſt all for his Holineſſe he fled to them? and leaſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould plead it as their priuiledge, call to minde how the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe</hi> was receiued &amp; rewarded, firſt with <note place="margin">Vnde laeſleum in ſua congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latione ad Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertum Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducem de Seipſo.</note> the title of the Biſhopricke of <hi>Conſtance</hi> in <hi>France</hi> and afterward (becauſe <hi>Conſtance</hi> by reaſon of the warres was little worth) with a promiſe of the Archbiſhoprike of <hi>Macklin,</hi> and that hee might not ſtarue in the meane time, hee had a penſion aſſigned him of fiftie ſcutes a moneth, which though it was moſt ill fauouredly paide him, yet was it moſt fairely and frankely beſtowed on him: And howſoeuer you be not ſuch Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traitors to your owne ſtates, nor ſuch wel-deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing fauorits of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> as theſe two were, yet feare not for you ſhall at your firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming be welcome, and well refreſhed at the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Colledge,</hi> and after that know for your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, that euery day certaine pilgrimes of ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nations dine in the <hi>Popes</hi> preſence, of meate from his owne table, bleſſed with his owne moſt holy hands: (oh who were not worthy to want it that would not poſt from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> for ſuch a dinner) And it is but a reaſonable ſute to ſome <hi>Cardinall,</hi> or the fathers of the <hi>Colledge</hi> to be often made gueſts at this table, the very crummes
<pb facs="tcp:14366:7"/> whereof gathered vp and carried away are of as much vertue as many of the Reliques in Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>Now then ſeeing there be ſuch entertainments and rewards to be had for the bodie, as theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples proue and ſuch riches for the ſoule, as this Booke declares, let vs leaue theſe Heretikes to wallow in their mire, let couetous Merchants goe to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and Gallants to <hi>Guiana:</hi> let ſilly Catholikes goe dwell in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and fooles into <hi>Virginia:</hi> Let vs take a wiſer courſe and poſt to <hi>Rome,</hi> where wee are ſure to haue as good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement as wee deſerued at home, and to finde as much honeſty as holineſſe, and as much happineſſe as both: And as the Heretikes make themſelues ſport with this Booke, becauſe (poore fooles) they beleeue it not: ſo doe you more wiſely who know it to bee true, take it with you, reade it in your iourney for your recreation, and when you come there, examine the truth of it Church by Church: And if you finde the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques there as pretious, and as full of vertue and value, as you will finde the relation heere made of them to bee true, I dare ſay you will bee the richeſt and happieſt people in the world: And further, off this bee aſſured for your better content, the Heretikes will not ſo much enuy your rich and happie State in <hi>Rome,</hi> as they doe the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle libertie you haue in <hi>England:</hi> and to ſay truth (If I may without offence) they are not ſuch cruel
<pb facs="tcp:14366:7"/> bloud-ſuckers, as wee ſpeake and write of them, for I haue often heard many of them ſay, they had rather haue you all ſent away to <hi>Rome,</hi> then the bloud of any of you to bee ſhead in <hi>England.</hi> And that you may require them for this courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. Let mee aduiſe you when you come at <hi>Rome,</hi> and now and then for your recreation goe foorth to ſee an Heretike burnt after a ſeſſions from the Holy houſe (where it is pretty ſport to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes to ſee how the fat Friers out, and how the burning Torches bring away pieces of their, fleſh) then if it happen to bee an Engliſh-man, doe him this fauour for countries ſake, to get him a little ſooner diſpatched out of his paine: But I put you to too much paine, by keeping you ſo long from preparing for your Iourney, which I am ſure you will doe as ſoone as you haue read this Booke, vnleſſe it bee you doubt of the truth of it, (which none will doe that are true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes,) and then I ſuſpect you are turning Heretiks and therefore will wiſh, that for your puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you neuer ſee Maſſe againe, and for your penance may euery Sunday heare a Sermon, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reade two Chapters of the Bible, and receiue the Euchariſt once a moneth, which moſt grieuous penance, if you would auoide, get you firſt to your Booke, and then to your Iourney.</p>
            <p>And as true as the Pope is as (wee call him) the Vickar of Chriſt, and his breſt the habitation of Holineſſe and truth, and (as the Cannon-law
<pb facs="tcp:14366:8"/> calls him our Lord God, ſo certainely you will bee moſt happie in your Iourney, and moſt welcome to his Holineſſe, eſpetially if you leaue all you haue in <hi>England,</hi> and come to him poore and vnprouided, and ſo giue him occaſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his Charity, for you know, He and his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls, and all his Court hold it a better thing to giue them to reciue.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:14366:10"/> of! his Exchequer is neuer empty, and what ſilly fooles are the Heretickes to depriue themſelues they know not of what?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="sup">c</hi> We read (ſay the <hi>Caluiniſts)</hi> in the fathers, of bookes Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, and the Papiſts tell vs of houres Canonicall: but of any booke called by the name of Canonicall it ſelfe, or any thing elſe ſo called, they might do well to haue told vs more plainly and particularly: for <hi>Poſſevine</hi> the Ieſuite their good friend, who takes vpon him ſo exactly to deſcribe all Authors and their bookes, ſpeaking of this <hi>Silveſter,</hi> mentioneth no ſuch Booke, therfore take heed this Canonicall proue not ſome Apocriphal, hidden and forged ſtory. Thus prate the Heretickes out of their ignorance and preſumption, not knowing that the holy and authenticall Canon law of the Pope teacheth in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that the Popes Decretall Epiſtles are numbred amongſt Canonicall Scriptures: but theſe <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> care little, it ſeemes, what the Popes law ſaith, they are all for <hi>Scripture, Scripture,</hi> and that makes them ſuch Heretickes as they be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="sup">d</hi> If this be true, that there were in <hi>Silueſters</hi> time 1505 Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in Rome, how comes it to paſſe (ſay the Heretickes) that the greater number is now defaced? it cannot bee ſaid to bee done in time of perſecution: for in <hi>Silueſters</hi> time the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Heathen were all ceaſed. What then, hath Popiſh deuotion puld downe the Churches that the perſecutions left ſtanding? Hath Rome been Gods Church, and Gods houſe all theſe yeares, and yet puld downe aboue 800 Churches? They accuſe Proteſtants of pulling downe Churches, but they cannot ſhew ſo many puld downe in this whole kingdome as here they haue done in one Citie: And for theſe that are downe, mens corruptions, not our religion tooke them away, ſauing ſome few which being needleſſe and ſuperfluous, others or more in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more needfull haue been erected for them. But if any good Catholicke heare any Hereticke babling on this faſhion, ſtoppe his mouth preſently and tell him, that their Churches beeing Hereticall Churches, therefore the more the worſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="sup">e</hi> None may ſay Maſſe at theſe Altars but the Pope, or thoſe that haue licenſe from him; but hee tels vs not (ſay the <hi>Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts)</hi> who may preach in their Pulpits. An idle obiection, and ſo let all good Catholickes hold it: for what is Preaching to a Maſſe? euen nothing at all: nay, its hard to ſay whether the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church hath got more good by Maſſes, or hurt by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and therefore let all deuout Catholickes neuer ſtumble, at it, if in all Catholicke bookes they finde the altar ſo much ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, and the pulpit ſo little: the Altar ſo magnified, and the Pulpit ſet aſide: for his Holineſſe well knoweth, it is the <hi>Altar</hi> that ſends him in his rent, hee neuer got any thing by the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits;
<pb facs="tcp:14366:11"/> what he hath loſt by them hee knowes and feeles ſo well, that if he knew how to carry it cleanly, he would rid his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as cleane of them as he hath done of the Bibles in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongue. In the meane time his Holineſſe out of great wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, is content that any diſgraces be caſt vpon Preaching that can bee deuiſed, inſomuch as if any bee great preachers in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Countries, it is enough to ſuſpect them for heretickes, and their bookes muſt be purged, witneſſe <hi>Stella, Ferus,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others; and though Chriſt and the Scriptures ſeeme to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie preaching neuer ſo much, yet good Catholickes muſt not care for it, but muſt know that Chriſt ſpake what was fit for thoſe times; but his Holineſſe knowes and muſt appoint what is fit for theſe times: and therefore hee will notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding giue it what place he liſt. And if any man offer to compare it with the Maſſe, it is little better then Hereſie. But Frier <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo,</hi> a great preacher in Rome, could not containe, but in the hearing of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13, deliuered this in the Pulpit: <hi>That it is of greater worth before God, and more profitable to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to heare Gods Word preached, then to ſee a Maſſe.</hi> But what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed? His holy ſtomacke could digeſt no ſuch doctrine, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſuch blaſphemy againſt his God: and therefore forthwith he conſtrained the poore Frier to go vp againe, and in the ſame place to eate his words, &amp; to teach the contrary. Thus he made him in the Pulpit to diſgrace the Pulpit, &amp; in the place of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to diſparage preaching. And not thus content, he alſo ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended the Frier from preaching; yea his recantation could not keepe him from ſuſpenſion: and no maruell, for hee that durſt magnifie preaching aboue the Maſſe, is not a man fit to preach in Rome.</p>

               <hi>Azorius,</hi> who was one of the principall founders of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitiſme.
<pb facs="tcp:14366:12"/> This was he, whom as <hi>Poſſevine</hi> reporteth, <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth, called to Rome, to be one of them that ſhould make lawes and orders for the whole ſociety. This holy Ieſuite ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing gotten ſome ſecret inſpiration from his Holineſſe, and ſuckt out of the Popes owne breaſt more pure Popery then all the reſt, he goeth further, and ſaith: It is the common opinion that there is no Diuine law compelling or commanding Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to heare Sermons on the Sabboth or feſtiuall dayes. And whereas there was ſo much goodneſſe in the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> as the Heretickes call it, or rather ſo much curioſity as we may ſay, as to decree that Biſhops ſhould diligently admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their people, and tell them that they are bound to come to their pariſh Churches to heare Gods word. <hi>Azorius</hi> the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite hath anſwere ready, that the Biſhops are bid to <hi>warne</hi> them, not to <hi>compell</hi> them: and if that ſeeme too ſlight, he hath a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in ſtore, whereas (ſaith he) the Councell would haue them come to heare Gods word, that muſt be vnderſtood of the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell</hi> in the <hi>Maſſe:</hi> for is there not a Goſpell read in euery Maſſe? and is not the Goſpell Gods word? Then he that comes to the Maſſe heares a Goſpell read, and conſequently heares Gods word: Is not here deepe diuinity? and ſhall not an ignorant man be well edified when hee heares a peece of the Goſpell read in Latine, whereof he vnderſtandeth not one word? Yes doubtleſſe, ſaith learned <hi>Ledeſma</hi> the Ieſuit, if they come with deuotion, and a good intent. Thus then you ſee that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a meane matter in reſpect of the Maſſe. And this is the reaſon why here and elſewhere in our Liturgies and chiefe and beſt bookes of ſtate, as our <hi>Miſſall, Pontificall, Ceremoniall, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotall</hi> and the like, for one mention of a Sermon and a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, you ſhall heare a hundred times of an Altar and a Maſſe: And if this bee done by the Church, and that Church cannot erre, then all good Catholickes muſt know, that not Pulpits &amp; Preaching, but Altars and Maſſes muſt they looke after. The Heretickes I confeſſe do hereat take great offence, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon doe cauill and raile bitterly, and ſay, that it is no maruel to ſee the pope preferre the Altar before the Pulpit, &amp; a Maſſe before preaching: for ſay they, and my eares haue heard them ſay it to my great griefe, if they gained no more by the one then the other, his Holineſſe would be faine to ſtrike ſaile, for the wings of his pride would ſoon be clipt. He tels vs (ſay they) of a miracle in Tranſubſtantiation, that the Bread and Wine are turned into Chriſts Body and Bloud, and there remaines nothing but the faſhion, colour, or likeneſſe of Bread and wine: But as our faith findes none ſuch in Scripture, no more doth our bodily ſence finde it in experience.

               <pb facs="tcp:14366:14"/> tell them of a much more true and ſenſible wonder daily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them: for their Pulpits are tranſubſtantiated (if we may be ſo bold with their word, for Gods it is not) into Altars: their Preachers into Prieſts, their Sermons into Sacrifices, their Bibles into Miſſals; and theſe are ſo abſolutely altered, and really changed, that indeed there remaines nothing but names and ſhadowes. For the other haue the ſubſtance. Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits (ſay they) are for Lent, Altars for euery day. Maſſes are commanded, Sermons but aduiſed: Sermons may doe well, but Maſſes are neceſſary. The Bible hath bred many hereſies, but the Maſſe booke breeds and feedes deuotion: Therefore Gods <note place="margin">Dan. 11. 36 37. 38.</note> booke, the Bible, is to be remoued from the people, as a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing, and the Maſſe booke of mans making, is to bee their daily bread. Is not this the ſame, ſay they, (or as bad) that <hi>Daniel</hi> propheſieth of, that <hi>there ſhall be a King that ſhall doe what him liſt, and ſhall exalt himſelfe, and magnifie himſelfe againſt all that is God, and ſpeake maruellous things againſt the God of Gods, and ſhall proſper till the wrath be accompliſhed, &amp;c. Neither ſhall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the deſires of women, nor care for any God: for hee ſhall magnifie himſelfe aboue all. And in ſtead of God, ſhall worſhip his God</hi> Mauzzim, <hi>euen the God that his fathers knew not.</hi> Whether their Maſſe be this <hi>Mauzzim</hi> here meant, or no, ſay they, we affirme not: once this is cleere, that hee hath turned his <hi>Maſſe</hi> into a <hi>Mauzzim,</hi> and made an Idoll of it, and worſhips in it a God of his owne making, a God that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers knew not: for his tranſubſtantiation and his propitiatory ſacrifice (which two be the life and ſoule of the Maſſe) were not knowne in the ancient and pureſt Church for 500 yeares after Chriſt. And this <hi>Mauzzim</hi> is ſet vp in the very roome of <hi>God.</hi> For ſince the Maſſe was erected vnto this height it is at, Chriſt neuer had his due, but was deſpoiled of his Offices and Honour, Gods booke caſt aſide, and a Maſſe booke laid in his place: Sermons accounted but things indifferent, or conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but Maſſes the onely neceſſary duty of the Sabboth day. And as he here ſaith, No man may ſay Maſſe at the high Altars of the ſeuen Churches in Rome but the Pope, or his Deputie; but you ſhall finde no ſuch prerogatiue for preaching here, or elſe-where. <hi>Ariſe O Lord, mainteine thine owne cauſe, againſt that Idoll the Maſſe, and Mauzzim of the Romiſh Synagogue.</hi> Thus madly and extrauagantly doe theſe idle heretickes prate: but let not this, nor ought that can be brought out of Scripture, trouble any good Catholicke conſcience, theſe be but the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Diuell, let him hearken what the Pope teacheth, who is Gods Vicar, and <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor: and if they be good Catholickes, they know that he cannot erre; and that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
<pb facs="tcp:14366:15"/> he doth or teacheth as he is Pope, it is all one as if <hi>God</hi> did it or taught it: let hereticks then if they will, extoll preaching, let this ſatisfie deuout Catholicks, that here the Pope takes or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for ſaying Maſſe, reſeruing certaine Churches to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, at whoſe high Altars none may ſay Maſſe but himſelfe, or ſome by commiſſion from him: but finde me any whoſe pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits he reſerues to himſelfe: nay finde me any in whoſe pulpits he will come at all. No, it is too baſe a place, and preaching too painfull a duty for his holineſſe, hee harh ſomething elſe to doe, as namely, to create Cardinals, to tranſlate Empires, and diſpoſe of Kingdomes, to reade and anſwere letters from the Princes of the earth, and to giue audience to their Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, to controll Kings when they diſpleaſe his holineſſe, and to excommunicate them if they ſubmit not to his pleaſure, and if they perſiſt, to depoſe them, and diſcharge their ſubiects of their oath and alleageance, to giue their kingdomes to whom he liſt; and to raiſe their owne ſubiects againſt them; to augment Saint <hi>Petars</hi> patrimony, by procuring Princes and Dukes to giue him the reuerſions after them, to goe and take poſſeſſions of the Prouinces that fall to him by ſuch excheates as <hi>Clemens</hi> the 5 did lately of <hi>Ferrara;</hi> to make leagues betwixt Princes, and to breake them when he ſeeth good, yea though they be confirmed by Oath and Sacrament <note n="*" place="margin">Vide Peter Math in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſtitutiones Pont.

Theſe are imployments fit for Popes, and not to buſie their brains, and ſpend their ſpirits about preaching. And are theſe all? Nay, who is able to recount all the honourable affaires his Holineſſe hath to manage. Therfore fie vpon theſe <note place="margin">Decretum.</note> fooliſh heretickes, who hold that the Pope ought to preach. For is not he the vniuerſall Biſhop of the world, and Paſtor of Paſtors? and is not all the world his prouince? and is not the care of the whole world, and gouernement of the whole Church laid on his ſhoulders? how then can he finde time to preach? For beſides all the aforenamed weighty imployments, he hath much more to do, and which none can doe, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb facs="tcp:14366:16"/> as namely, to receiue appeales from all parts of the world made vnto him, to review matters iudged, and reuerſe, diſanull, and alter them at his pleaſure, to nominate and fill the Abbacies and Biſhoprickes of the world as they fall voyd, to elect into all places, or at leaſt to confirme the elections made by others, to ſend his prouiſions into all Lands for what liuings he liſt, againſt they be voyd, that hee may haue them to gratifie his Minions: to appoynt generall Councels, when and where, and as oft as hee pleaſeth, to call them, continue them, proroge them, remoue them, diſſolue them: to nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie or confirme them as he liſt; or to take that that is for him, and reiect that that is againſt him, as hee did, and yet doth in the Councels of <hi>Conſtantinople, Chalcedon, Conſtance,</hi> and <hi>Baſill:</hi> To deuiſe and create new reliques when the old ones are loſt, periſht, or worne, and to hallow them, that deuout Catholickes may haue what to worſhip, and ſo may be encouraged to pay their rents well: and when need is, to execute his admirable skill in Arithmetical Multiplication, or rather his tranſcendent power and Omnipotency for the multiplying of holy reliques, as hee did to the great comfort and edification of his Church, when he multiplyed S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſts</hi> head, of one making three, and of the three Kings of <hi>Collen,</hi> making three more: and found out a third arme of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and that little and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Croſſe which <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> once bare vpon his ſhoulders, he by his mighty power hath multiplied in ſuch ſort as now ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a ſhip in the world, can carry it. And as he multiplied the ſubſtance, ſo hath he changed the nature and quality, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing curſed before, he hath made it now ſo bleſſed, that (as he <note place="margin">Gretſerus de Cruce, Tom. 1. Cap.</note> teacheth) it ought to be worſhipped with the ſame worſhip as Chriſt himſelfe. Oh ſilly heretickes, that will tye him to ſtudy and preach that hath theſe things to doe: what, thinke they that theſe can be done in a day? No, no, it hath coſt the holy Mother Church many a yeares labour, and it hath ſore beaten her braine to bring theſe matters to this paſſe. As for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of the nails that faſtned <hi>Chriſts</hi> body to the croſſe, which of 3, are brought to more then 23: that we will not ſpeake of, as being but a ſmall mater: for euery Goldſmith can make of one great plate of gold 100 little ones, and euery one as good gold as the great one, but let vs leaue that, and proceed to ſee what further imployments his holineſſe hath. Hath he no more to doe? Yes, to weed out the hereſies that ſpring ſo faſt with the hookes of his holy Inquiſitions, to confute the heretickes with thoſe excellent arguments of Fire and Fagot, Daggs and Daggers, Piſtols and Poniards, Murders, and Maſſacres: to looke to the bookes and writings of the world, that nothing be
<pb facs="tcp:14366:17"/> left that may make againſt him: to allow what and how many hee will haue read, and to barre or prohibite all the reſt: and for thoſe that are to be read, to alter them as hee ſeeth cauſe: taking out what makes againſt him, and putting in what nay make for him: ſurely he hath little time to ſpare, that hath all this to doe. And yet hee hath more to doe. namely, to create new religions, and ſet vp new orders. For Chriſt when hee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, left but one religion in the world: but to multiply that one into many, and to deriue 100 ſeuerall from it, and yet all theſe to be religions: this labour, becauſe it beſeemed not the Author of vnity to leaue many, but one religion, he left to his Vicar, who hath performed it moſt diligently: for ſince his Aſcenſion into heaven, he hath reared vp at leaſt an hundred more then Chriſt euer thought of: and yet ſtil euery day he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſeth more, all tied together by the tailes, like <hi>Sampſons</hi> Foxes, but euery one looking and drawing ſeuerall wayes, one pulling againſt another, one enuying and ſupplanting another, ſo that another buſineſſe that much troubleth him, is to reconcile them one to another, and yet all he can doe, is not ſufficient to keepe them in loue and amity. And when hee ſeeth any of them grow too high, and too full of wealth, then another part of his care is to ſqueaze the ſpunge, being too full, as hee did the Templars for their lands and riches, whoſe order he puld downe, and burnt their <hi>great Maiſter</hi> at <hi>Paris.</hi> Thus to create newe religions, and erect new orders, to keepe them from one ouerthrowing another, and to diſſolue them againe when he ſeeth cauſe, are not theſe ſufficient imployments to keepe him from preaching, if he had no other? yet there is one more, and that no ſmall one, which he hath to doe, namely, to looke to the ſucceſſion of Princes, and to take care how kingdomes may be prouided when their Princes either dye, or be by him depoſed. As <hi>Innocentius</hi> the fourth hauing depoſed <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Alexander</hi> the fourth tooke paines to make a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree touching the ſucceſſion of the Empire, publiſhing a Bull, prohibiting and forbidding the Electors to chuſe <hi>Conradus</hi> his ſonne to be Emperour. A fact without example, and beyond beliefe, that a forraine Prince ſhould publickly dare to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelfe in a forraine election, and publiſh his letter to the world written againſt that Prince, whom the Princes Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and all the Chriſtian world had their eyes vpon, as the moſt probable ſucceſſor of the Empire. But by this, that idle Heretikes, <hi>Huguenots, Caluiniſts,</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> may ſee that the Pope is tied to no preſidents of other Princes; nay, he is to giue example to all, but to take of none; and they may ſee, that the fact that would haue beene foule in another Prince,
<pb facs="tcp:14366:18"/> is in him not onely iuſtifiable, but commendable. And though they babble and ſay, that if the wiſe and iudicious reader make himſelfe the reader of that Bull, (for it is inrolled in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Regiſter, and inſerted for a perpetuall preſident in the continuation of the corps of his Canon law) he will ſee in that one alone the compleat and liuely picture of the great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt: yet all good Catholiques know, that therein they doe but ſhew themſelues open Heretickes, that dare call in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the facts of their holy Father: who though he ſhould draw millions of ſoules into hell, yet no mortall creature ought to ſay; <hi>Sir, why doe you ſo?</hi> And alſo it did little hurt, for that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade</hi> euen maugre the Popes malice, as the heretickes ſay, was choſen Emperour; yet ſhewed it the Popes good will and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care ouer kingdomes, that they may be prouided of ſuch ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors as may be to his liking: and it ſhewes in what holy and mortified cogitations and actions he ſpends his time, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in diſpoſing the Crownes and Kingdomes of the earth.</p>
            <p>Now then put all theſe together, &amp; are not theſe fit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per imployments for the Popes Maieſty? A <hi>Figge</hi> therefore, or rather a <hi>Fagot</hi> for theſe fooliſh Heretiques, that will tie his Holineſſe to preach? What? is it fit his ſoueraignty ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare and forſake theſe ſupreame prerogatiues, and ſtoope downe to ſo baſe a buſineſſe as preaching is? No, no, <hi>Aquila non capit muſcas.</hi> Indeed the caſe was otherwiſe heretofore in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, but they are gone. Preaching might beſeeme <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> or <hi>Leo</hi> the great, or their Predeceſſors, and no maruell, for ſeeing then there were Emperours that would gouerne the world, and <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelfe, and ſet peace betweene kingdomes, call generall Councels, keepe the Pope within compaſſe, and command him to his duty; What therefore had the Popes to doe but to Preach? But <hi>Haec aetas alios mores poſtulat:</hi> then the Popes called and acknowledged the Emperours their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lords, now they be their ſeruants, and if they pleaſe them well, their beloued white ſonnes, and ſhall haue the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to hold his ſtirrop, leade his horſe, hold the baſen, when he waſheth, and bring vp the firſt diſh when his Holineſſe eates. Then therefore they had time and leaſure to preach; but now as we haue ſhewed, they haue ſo farre better buſineſſes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and ſo farre higher imployments to manage, that they haue no leaſure.</p>

            <p>Againe, theſe idle and adle-headed Heretickes that would tie the Pope to the Pulpit, neuer conſider that euery man is to be diſpoſed to that which he is fitteſt for, and which thriueth beſt in his hands. Now doe we not know, that Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22.
<pb facs="tcp:14366:19"/> who would needs be ſo buſie with preaching (which indeed he vſed more then many before him, and all after him) hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a preſident to all his ſucceſſors: for did not he fall vpon the rocks of ſtrange opinions, little leſſe then hereſies in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his owne friends? And hath not <hi>Occham</hi> the famous <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Frier, written an accuſation againſt him, that not in one, but in many Sermons, he taught not one or two, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeuerall (and ſome condemned) hereſies? Such was the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of his preaching, and ſo ill hath preaching ſucceeded in the hands and mouthes of Popes. Whereas contrariwiſe when they goe about the conſecration of Biſhips, coronation of Emperours, depoſing of Hereticke Kings, diſpoſing of their Kingdomes, granting diſpenſations, ſending out Indulgences, receiuing appeales, anſwering Embaſſadors, taking of homa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, releaſing of oathes, diſſoluing of leagues, intermedling in the affaires, and interpoſing in the elections of Princes. In theſe, and ſuch as theſe, which ſo well beſeeme the Maieſty of the Pope, he proceds and proſpers, and hereby he hath aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and magnified his ſeate, in the eyes of all his friends and fauourers; whereas when Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22. forgetting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and the honour and Maieſty of his place, would fall a preaching, he incurd at the leaſt ſo ſtrong a ſuſpition of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, as neither his Penitentiary <hi>Pelagius</hi> with all his teares, could waſh away: nor his ſucceſſor <hi>Benedict</hi> with his interpretatiue Bull to that purpoſe ſet out, could remoue: nor <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and all his beloued friends with their beſt wits and learning, can wipe off to this day; nor euer will whilſt the works of learned <hi>Ocham</hi> doe liue in the world. Is it not therefore an idle conceit of theſe bawling heretickes, that will haue the Pope to preach, which in theſe latter times of the world doth ſo ill beſeeme them, and proſpers ſo badly in their hands?</p>
            <p>And if they obiect, that Preaching is a principall part of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſeruice, and of Gods worſhip: and therfore beſt of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeems the Pope that is Gods vicar, &amp; neereſt to him: Let them know buſie fooles as they be, that it is not determined among the Schoolemen and Caſuiſts, whether hearing a Sermon bee at all commanded, or rather but counſelled and aduiſed: ſo that herein they doe but ſhew their owne Ignorance. But the great learned Ieſuite <hi>Azorius</hi> can teach them, and beſide him <hi>Mola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> that it may well be a counſell to heare a Sermon on the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly day, but they are aſſured there is no commandement for it: ſo that the doing of it may be a worke of ſupererogation, but cannot be a dutie of neceſſity. But if it were allowed to theſe hereticks, that it were a neceſſary dutie to make and heare Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and a part of Gods worſhip; yet ſure they cannot bee ſo

               <pb facs="tcp:14366:21"/> ignorant as not to know, nor ſo prophane as once to doubt, but that the ſaying and ſeeing of a Maſſe is farre before it. For thus doe all the beſt approued Schoolemen and Caſuiſts teach with one voyce, and do reproue the elder Doctors, or doaters rather for their preſumption in holding the contrary. For <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Angelica,</hi> and <hi>Summa Roſella</hi> doe both teach, that where it falles out (which theſe Heretickes ought to know falls not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out in Popiſh Churches) that on one day a Sermon and a Maſſe ſo come together, as both cannot be heard, but the one muſt neceſſarily be omitted: in this caſe the Maſſe is to be left and the Sermon preferred. And theſe ſottiſh fellowes ſeeme to proue their aſſertion out of the <hi>Canon-law,</hi> and out of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> and out of <hi>Auſtine,</hi> (and it's maruell they brought not <hi>Scripture</hi> for them alſo, as all theſe heretickes, and maintainers of new opinions vſe to doe.) But let all theſe ſtoope, for a <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite</hi> comes in place, let the <hi>Canon-law</hi> vaniſh like ſmoake, let the <hi>Doctors</hi> goe to the Schoole againe and learne, and let the <hi>Scripture,</hi> that dumbe Iudge, ſtand aſide in a corner, and let vs hearken to the irrefragable, vnanſwerable, ſoueraigne, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perexcellent determination of the Ieſuits, <hi>The men that were borne to bleſſe the world, to ſaue it from ſinking, to purge it of Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call bookes, and rid it of hereticall Kings, to reſtore learning, and preſerue the truth, which without them had periſhed, to make plaine and perfect the Scriptures, which till their time lay neglected, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all controuerſies, reade all riddles, know all ſecrets, heare all confeſſions, and (to diſcouer no more then makes for their purpoſe) cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure all queſtions, ſatisfie all conſciences, reſolue all doubts; and in a word, to be the very Oracles of the Chriſtian world, as holy, as true, and as infallible as euer was that of Delphos, or Iupiter Hamon.</hi> I ſay, let vs hearken how thoſe reuerend Ieſuits, and for them all, how renoumed <hi>Azor,</hi> one of their moſt glorious Fathers, and founders of that bleſſed company, handles this queſtion.</p>
            <q>It's moued (ſaith hee) and made a queſtion, if on one day a Maſſe and a Sermon doe ſo concurre, as both cannot bee heard, whether is to be omitted with leſſe loſſe and ſinne. The fore-named Doctors, and many other more (Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as they be) doe teach that the Maſſe muſt yeeld to the Sermon.</q>
            <p>And the good Ieſuit ingenuouſly confeſſeth, which hee doth: not for that hee holds Ieſuits tied to ſpeake truth (who can ſpeake nothing but truth, and whatſoeuer they ſpeake, is therefore truth becauſe they ſpeake it) but becauſe the more and greater his Aduerſaries be, the more glorious is the victory: Therefore he freely confeſſeth, that many of the Popiſh Doctors be of the ſame opinion; and that they ground
<pb facs="tcp:14366:22"/> this their opinion upon the <hi>Decrees,</hi> and vpon S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> But what are all theſe to ſuch ſincere, learned, and iuditious men as the Ieſuits, euen nothing at all when once the truth comes in queſtion: for then downe goe <hi>Doctors, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Councels, Scriptures,</hi> and all to make roome for the holy Catholique <hi>Romiſh Truth,</hi> out of the Ieſuites holy mouthes. In which Catholique zeale, the noble Ieſuit thus reſolues the queſtion.</p>
            <q>But whatſoeuer (ſaith he) theſe, or any of theſe, or all theſe, or any other doe thinke, <hi>It is to bee ſaid,</hi> (Marke yee dull Heretiques, with what maieſty a Ieſuit concludes againſt Canon-law, Schoole-men, and Fathers, and tremble when you ſee what potent aduerſaries you haue of them.) <hi>It is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to be held without controll, That the Maſſe, which is to be heard by the Churches commandement, is to be preferred before the hearing of the holy word of God.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>And marke his reaſon whereby hee proues it: for though it bee no reaſon to expect a reaſon from ſo great, ſo graue, ſo godly men as the Fathers of the Society, who by their nature and conſtitution will not thinke, ſpeake, nor doe any thing without a reaſon; yet is his Father-hood here pleaſed to giue vs a reaſon: but marke it I ſay againe, for it's as good, as honeſt and as religious a reaſon, and as well-beſeeming a Ieſuit, as the opinion it ſelfe.</p>
            <q>The Maſſe (ſaith he) is to be preferred before the Sermon, and the Sermon is to be omitted for the Maſſe, for that (ſaith he) there is great difference betwixt that that is due by Commandement, and that that's due by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: for that that's due by Commandement may not bee omitted, nor can be, vnder paine of mortall ſinne. But it is no ſinne to omit that that's due onely by Counſell: Now the Maſſe is commanded, Preaching is but counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: to heare a Maſſe a man is tied by vertue of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, to heare a Sermon he is but counſelled, or aduiſed: therefore it's apparant, that a man is bound to preferre the Maſſe before a Sermon, and to omit or looſe a Sermon for a Maſſe.</q>
            <p>And thus ſo learnedly, ſo holily, ſo irrefragably is this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion reſolued, that none but profeſſed foes to the holy <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, and open enemies to the Maſſe, and aduancers of that dangerous booke called the Scriptures, (and who therefore are iuſtly condemned for Heretickes) can, or will, or dare gaineſay it. And as for thoſe that durſt hold the contrary, though they were none of them of theſe vp-ſtart Heretickes, yet it's not fit that they paſſe without reproofe, and iuſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb facs="tcp:14366:23"/> for this their ſo groſſe ignorance, or ſo foule impiety, as to perfer a Sermon before a Maſſe; and therefore ſaith the Ieſuite religiouſly and learnedly, like himſelfe:</p>
            <q>If this be ſo, It will bee here demanded, whether <hi>Angelus,</hi> and the reſt that hold this <hi>Deteſtable Error,</hi> that a Sermon is to bee heard rather then a Maſſe, bee to bee condemned as holders of a <hi>Timerariouſe</hi> opinion. Some ſaith he, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely condemne it and them ſo to be: Others hold it to bee a falſe Opinion, but not <hi>Temerariouſe:</hi> And thus they excuſe them, and they gloſſe it ouer with ſome ſhewes and ſhadows of argument; as if it were a hard caſe for the Church to tye a man, for the gazing of a maſſe, to looſe ſo great a matter as a Sermon. But this is idle (ſaith the Ieſuite) and therfore (for you ſhall alwaies ſee Ieſuites take the better part) ſeeing they haue no good reaſon for their opinion, in my iudgement the opinion is to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>Temerariouſe,</hi> and they to bee condemned to haue ſpoken <hi>Temerariouſly,</hi> that is, raſhly, vnaduiſedly, and without iudgement.</q>
            <p>So then theſe Heretickes might ſee, if they were not blind, that in the holy Romane Church, it is ſo firmely holden that a Sermon is not ſo good, ſo holy, ſo neceſſary, as a Maſſe: That whoeuer holds the contrary, be it <hi>Caluiniſt,</hi> or Schooleman, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Councell, they are ſubiect to cenſure and puniſhment for it. And euen <hi>Bernard</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> may be glad they had ſo good hap to bee made Saints by that Romane Church; for otherwiſe, for this their impious conceit, <hi>to preferre a Sermon before a Maſſe,</hi> they had beene ſure, and that very worthily, to be condemned for Heretickes: But ſeeing the Church that cannot erre, hath vouchſafed to Canonize them for Saints, ſhe will therefore deale more mercifully with them then their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety deſerues, and at the humble mediation of the charitable Ieſuites, will onely pronounce them <hi>temerariouſe,</hi> but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them for Heretickes.</p>
            <p>If this then bee cleere, that by the reſolued Doctrine and Definition of the Romane Church, A Maſſe is the principall part, if not the whole worſhip of God; and that onely the Maſſe is ſtrictly commanded, and hearing of Gods word preached, is but conditionally aduiſed; And that therefore a Maſſe is farre more excellent in it ſelfe more auaileable with God, more profitable and comfortable to the ſoule, then is the hearing of ſermons: then who ſees not but if the Popes holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe praies but ſeldome or not at all; Yet doe often and continually ſay Maſſe, that then he hath ſtopped the mouthes of all heretickes, that like curres doe bawle and barke
<pb facs="tcp:14366:24"/> againſt him, and call him and his great Biſhops <hi>Dumbe Dogges that cannot barke:</hi> O ſilly fooles, theſe Heretickes, that bring theſe words of the Prophet againſt his Holineſſe. For doe they not know, that when the Prophet complained of thoſe dumbe dogges, that could not barke, there were then no Maſſes in the world: for if there had, hee would haue blamed their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in them, rather then of preaching; and this I ſay by the warrant and preſident of the <hi>Mariale,</hi> which ſaith, that whereas <hi>Salomon</hi> writes thus, <hi>The name of the Lord is a ſtrong Tower, the righteous flye vnto it, and are helped; Salomon</hi> (ſaith he) knew lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> for if he had, he would haue ſaid, <hi>The name of our Lady is a ſtrong Tower, the righteous flye vnto it, and are helped.</hi> And ſurely with as good right may I ſay, the Prophet knew little of the dignitie, vertue, and efficacie of the holy <hi>Maſſe,</hi> for if he had, hee would not haue blamed them for not preaching, but for negligence in ſaying Maſſe. But <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Eſay</hi> are both to be pardoned, becauſe of the times they liued in; but as for theſe Heretickes that liue in theſe times, and cannot but ſee the great vertue and high price that Maſſes are at, and how beneficiall they bee to the Catholicke Romane Church, and conſequently how good cauſe the Church hath to magnifie Maſſes aboue Preaching, they are without all excuſe, and their fault vnpardonable. But though they be ſo madde to moue it, and ſo malicious to preſſe it, that the Pope and all his Cleargy ought rather to preach then ſay Maſſes, yet hee is too wiſe to hearken to it: nay though ſometime ſome of his owne Catholicke children are bewitched with this poyſon, and are harping on this ſtring, that preaching is the greater, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier of the two, yet he hath wit enough to diſcouer, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to ſuppreſſe them in time: therefore if any of them write ſo, he commands it to be razed out of their bookes, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after it may not teſtifie againſt them: and if any be ſo bold, to preach it, his holineſſe takes ſuch order with them, as few dare follow their example. Witneſſe Frier <hi>Lobo,</hi> of whom wee ſpake before, whoſe iudgement was ſo iuſt, and ſentence ſo ſharpe by Pope <hi>Gregories</hi> owne holy mouth, for that his impious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, in preferring a Sermon before a Maſſe, and that alſo in <hi>Rome,</hi> where (like a foole that he was) he might haue remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that preaching hath been out of ſeaſon theſe 500 yeares: that from that day we haue not heard of any that durſt attempt the like in <hi>Rome,</hi> and if the like courſe had beene taken in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, France,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> theſe new hereſies had neuer ſpred as they do. For it is nothing but hearing Sermons, &amp; reading the Bible, that hath bred &amp; fed, and ſtill feeds and diſperſeth thoſe hereſies of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Caluiniſts,</hi> as daily and lamentable
<pb facs="tcp:14366:25"/> experience lets vs ſee and feele. For his Holineſſe knowes full well, that if he could but rid the world of the <hi>Bibles</hi> in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongues, and pull downe this talking trade of <hi>Preaching,</hi> we ſhould ſoone ſee theſe Hereſies, and this new Goſpell of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> melt away, and come to nothing: for take away the meanes and cauſe, and the effect will follow. And full well ſpoke a wiſe <hi>Cardinall</hi> to the Pope, when in a priuate conſultation there was complaint of the growing and ſpreading of <hi>Luthera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, Wee may thanke our ſelues</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and our owne ſloth and careleſneſſe for this, who let the Scriptures flye abroad, and become ſo common: for we ought to haue kept them (vnder colour of Maieſty, and to procure them greater Generation) in the learned tongues, and laid them vp in ſafe and ſecret Libraries, ſo ſhould neither they haue beene corrupted by heretickes and Iewes, as they haue beene: nor they haue corrupted and made ſo many Hereticks as they haue done.</hi> A wiſe and worthy ſpeech doubtleſſe, and well beſeeming a <hi>Cardinall,</hi> and a full deuout ſoule I warrant him was he of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church. And from that day forward hath the Pope beene more carefull in this poynt, and hath ſet on worke his darlings the <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> who haue done him faithfull ſeruice in this kinde, as may appear to their great honor, to al them that wil looſe a litle time to reade their bookes: for by their bookes, their Sermons and their perſwaſions, they haue ſo preuailed, that where euer any of them do remain, or but lurk, you ſhall not finde a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholicke, but he can learnedly prate againſt the Scriptures, (whereof he heartily thanks his God he neuer read one booke) and can tell you what a dangerous booke it is, and how many haue beene made Heretickes by it; and by this meanes their Diſciples bogle at it, and auoyd it, as ſnare, or a pit in the way, or a rocke in the ſea.</p>
            <p>Now if this bee true, that the Scripture is ſo dangerous a booke, and that preaching muſt be out of that booke, who ſees not, that therefore in good Popiſh reaſon, and Pope-holy reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it followeth, that it beſeemes all men to be wary, tender and dainty, euen how they make or heare too many Sermons. For if the Scripture be a dangerous booke, ſurely preaching cannot but be a dangerous exerciſe: in which regard appeares the wiſedome of the holy <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, who hath ordained, there ſhall be Sermons daily in the Lent, in moſt great Cities, and ſo by making them proper to Lent, ſhe makes them ſeeme to be out of ſeaſon all the yeare beſides, and in moſt places neuer expected, neuer thought of, till Lent come againe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as contrariwiſe the holy and bleſſed Maſſe is alwayes in ſeaſon, and by the ſtrict order of the holy <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is daily to be ſaid without omiſſion: nay, ſome dayes two or three, and
<pb facs="tcp:14366:26"/> euery day the more the better. So then ſermons are but the Lent prouiſion, but Maſſes are the <hi>daily bread</hi> of the holy Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholikes.</p>
            <p>And howſoeuer the holy fathers the Popes and his Cardinals doe not trouble their heads nor diſturbe the peoples mindes with much preaching, yet they make them a bountifull amends with the multitude of Maſſes wherein all good Catholikes know they doe but as if a houſholder kept away courſe bread, and gaue his people ſtore of fine Manchets for it: for what bee ſermons but as courſe bread, but the Maſſes theſe bee the fine Manchers, they be the dainty feeding for the refined ſtomackes of all Romiſh Catholikes: Therefore let theſe bawling here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes know, that becauſe the Popes Holineſſe ſawe the olde Church in former times ſurfetted of Sermons, and that euery hereticke brought Scripture preſently for his hereſie, therefore in theſe latter &amp; more prudent times they haue made a bleſſed exchange, and for poore homely veſtments wodden Chalices, and a golden Cleargy, haue giuen the people goodly rich Copes and golden Chalices good ſtore to make amends for their leaden Biſhops and wodden Prieſts, which we cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but are plentifull in many Catholique countries. For the Scripture in the vulgar tongues which thereby was made too common and expoſed to contempt, haue giuen them the Latine Goſpell in the Maſſe, which is read ſo ſolemnly, ſo ſtately, and with ſuch glorious ceremonies, that all the people ſtand ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with admiration and amazement, and are oftentimes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified as much by it as he that reads it, becauſe he that reads it oftentimes vnderſtands it as well as they that heare it. And for that vnreaſonable much preaching with which S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> S. <hi>Baſill,</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtine, Origen, Ambroſe, Leo, Gregory,</hi> and other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, did conſume their time, good ſimple plaine meaning men they were for thoſe times, but full ſilly God wot if they bee compared with the holy Roman Father of theſe daies) and with which they did fill the peoples heads; they haue giuen them the celeſtiall foode of the bleſſed Maſſe, and hauing appointed preaching to the hard time of Lent (that ſo both the body and ſoule may faſt, feed hardly, and doe penance together) and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing commended it to Princes Courts, and great Cities and Cathedrall Churches, and that ſo it might be vſed and reſpected as a ſtate ceremony, they made Maſſes common and vulgar commanding (for the holy Mother Romane Church, is euer ſo gracious and mercifull and ſuch are the bowels of her bounty, as ſhe neuer takes any thing from her children, but ſhe giues them a better) that the people ſhould haue euery day a Maſſe or two one for their breakfaſt, and another or two or three for
<pb facs="tcp:14366:27"/> their dinner, and ſuch dainty feeding being ſo continuall, will make them not finde the want of ſuch homely fare as preaching is.</p>
            <p>And to that end for the peoples better content and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, ſhee hath holily and bountifully ordained, that not onely in Kings Courts and great places, but in euery Church, euery Chappell; nay at euery altar in euery Church, ſhall be euery day, a Sermon. A Sermon ſaid I, oh forgiue me ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father, forgiue mee ſo foule an error, I ſhould haue ſaid a Maſſe and not euery day onely but ſometimes more: In ſo much as in diuerſe great Churches there are by the Popes bounty ſo many altars, that there bee oftimes twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, Maſſes of a day in one Church, as the people there doe finde to their great edification; and trauellers to their great admiration, who when they ſee twenty or thirty, or more maieſticall Maſſes, like ſo many glorious Maskes, all in one great Church, in one forenoone, in euery ile, and euery corner one; No maruell if it aſtoniſh them, and make them ſay fie vpon theſe fooliſh, ſilly, poore, plaine, heretikes the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. Who in ſteed of all theſe (beſides the ordinary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſeruice, which is alſo made ſo common with them that euery one can ſay it at home when they liſt) are faine to bee content with one ſilly Sermon, or one plaine Communion: and hereupon it comes to paſſe that many one, who trauells out of Proteſtant into Popiſh cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, though they went away no great good Proteſtants, yet returne againe fine zealous Popiſh Catholikes, for the holy pictures, and goodly gilded Images, whereof many are made ſo artificially, as they can ſmile and laugh and ſpeake, by the mighty power of the Pope and his Prieſts, and the gorgeous ceremonies, and the pomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Veſtments, and the ſtately proceſſions, and the many maieſticall Maſſes, and the glorious light of the tapers bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning day and night in their darke Churches are all ſtrong and excellent well made cobwebs to catch ſuch flies in.</p>
            <p>And that all this may haue the more credit, his holineſſe hath wiſely ordained, that howſoeuer great men as Biſhops and Cardinalls haue little or no time to preach and therefore, and for the good reaſons aforeſaid ſhall not bee tied to it, but at their pleaſures, or at viſitation or certaine great daies (that ſo the ſermon may come in as a third courſe it a feaſt, neither certainely expected afore it come, nor much regarded when its come) yet none are ſo great, but that being Prieſts they are tied to the continuall ſaying of Maſſe whereeuer they bee, and to that end hee hath appointed it (becauſe the Maſſe in a ſacrifice, and no ſacrifice can bee without an altar) if
<pb facs="tcp:14366:28"/> there want an altar conſecrated, they ſhall haue altars made of a little ſquare ſtone which they may carry about with them, <note place="margin">This is called Altare porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile.</note> and ſhall ſerue at all occaſions, and theſe little moueable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars by vertue of the Popes bleſſings haue as much vertue as the great ſtanding altars, and the cake conſecrated, at theſe ſhall be as truely tranſubſtantiated and made as really the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and fleſh of Chriſt as at the other.</p>
            <p>And leaſt that this God of the holy father, and his Prieſts making, ſhould, like the Heathen Gods in continuance of time come into contempt, or leaſt that his Maozim the Maſſe ſhould become of leſſe account by the common, continuall and vulgar vſe; Or becauſe the generality of the Maſſe makers namely of the Monkes, Friers and ſecular Prieſts are held contemptible men: His Holineſſe therefore (in whoſe breſt all wiſdome that is not from aboue, doth reſide and dwell) hath politikely and worthily ordained, that in all great feaſt daies, Coronations of Princes, Conſecration of Biſhops, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of Churches, tranſlation of relikes, confirmation of leagues, Canonization of Saints: and in all publike mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, roiall aſſemblies, and euen in Generall Counſells, the chiefe of all, or one of the chiefe ſhall ſay the Maſſe; Nay often times himſelfe will vouchſafe to doe it, kindely and thankefully giuing ſome honour to it that yeilds him ſo much profit, and fills his coffers with ſo many millions of Crownes. And ſuch is the deuotion of his holineſſe, and ſo great his neglect of all the matters of this world (which hee with all his heart as willingly treds vnder his feete, as his predeceſſor <hi>Alexander</hi> trode vpon the necke of great <hi>Fredericke</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour) that in the morning, when other great men and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the world are making them ready for their recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then is his holineſſe full deuoutly fitting himſelfe to ſay Maſſe. And this hee doth not ſometime and ſeldome; But continually euery morning, as not onely his bookes tell vs, but as trauellors alſo teſtifie. Some whereof haue had the happineſſe and honour to bee preſent at the Popes morning Maſſe: Oh happy men to receiue ſo high and vnualuable a reward for their trauell and coſt. For what though they went two thouſand miles, &amp; ſpent twiſe two thouſand pounds, what is that in compariſon of this honour, theſe miles may be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and theſe pounds numbred. But the benefits they ſhall receiue by hearing the Pope ſay Maſſe are without number, I can name but one that is this. Hee that heares the Pope ſay Maſſe, eſcapes hell as he can, but I dare warrant him hee ſhall neuer come in Purgatory. Are not they therefore to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for their deuotion, and held for wiſe men in their
<pb facs="tcp:14366:29"/> countries, when they returne, that willingly bee at the coſt and labour to trauell to Rome to bee partaker of ſo bleſſed a Breakfaſt? Or rather were it not good that they might ſtay in Rome, and neuer bee ſuffered to returne that ſo they might neuer bee depriued of that bleſſedneſſe, and in ſteed of the homely fare in their countries bee fed with the excellent <hi>Manna</hi> of the Popes Maſſes: As for the Hugenets and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes they are well worthy to want it ſeeing they hold it not worth their labour, and therefore for their penance, let them bee enioyned to reade euery day two Chapters of that hard, harſh and homely booke cal'd the Bible, and to haue three Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons a weeke: and with thoſe Garlike and Onions, let theſe baſe ſtomakes bee contented, ſeeing they know not, nor care not for the dainty and coſtly <hi>Manna</hi> of the Maſſes of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Catholike Church.</p>
            <p>But what then (will theſe babbling Heretikes ſay) and doth the Pope neuer preach at all? What matter if hee doe not, ſeeing hee euery day ſaith Maſſe, which euery ſage Catholike knowes is farre better, for what tho Chriſt being vpon earth and in his glorified body after his reſurrection calling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether his Apoſtle, gaue them not onely commiſſion but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement alſo to goe and teach all Nations, and preach to euery Creature: Yet the holy Mother Church of Rome knowes that hee ſpoke it, as fir for thoſe times, but hee left his ſpirit to his Vikar, who ſhould ſupply and put downe what hee did not. And therefore whereas hee forgot to bid his Apoſtles <hi>ſay Maſſes,</hi> the Pope like a good Vikar addes what hee forgets, and commands all his Prieſts that howſoeuer they preach now and then, when they pleaſe; Yet that they miſſe not to ſay Maſſes daily, whilſt they liue: and for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſatisfaction of their Conſciences he hath by his power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; (which Chriſt neuer did, nor it ſeemes could doe) that preaching is but a Counſell, and Maſſe-ſaying a commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore Maſſes be neceſſary, and preaching but voluntary. If therefore the Popes Holineſſe neuer buſie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the pulpit and preaching, thats no great matter as long as hee euery day deuoutly ſings his Maſſe and offers vp the vnbloudie ſacrifice, which is a ſacrifice propitiatory for the ſinnes of quicke and dead, as ſure as hee is the Vikar of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But let them ſtoppe their mouthes and hold their babling for howſoeuer Preaching is a meere voluntary action, and a worke of ſuperogation, and the leaſt and laſt matter of twenty that belongs to a Maſſe, and the leaſt and baſeſt of a thouſand that his Holineſſe hath to doe: Yet let theſe Heretikes know
<pb facs="tcp:14366:30"/> his holineſſe doth not forſweare all preaching, for howſoeuer vpon thoſe common occaſions of calling, conuerting or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſoules, he cannot finde time to preach, but leaues that to ſuch of his Friers or Prieſts, as haue ſuch tender and preciſe conſciences as to thinke that preaching onely, ordinarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets faith: yet vpon other great and ſolemne occaſions, as when ſome Saint is to be canonized, at the mediation of ſome great Prince (who paies roially for it, and like a Prince) Or when ſome great King comes home from hereſie, and honours himſelfe and makes himſelfe ſo happy, as to kiſſe his holy foote and be reconciled, and pay a round ranſome for his, former rebellion as <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth did. Or when ſome ſuch bleſſed worke is attempted &amp; archiued as was that Maſſacre at Paris, and in the moſt great Cities of France (where the Heretikes were kill'd vp like Rats or madde Dogges, where euer they could be catcht, and ſo were ſent to hell by heapes) Or when ſome yong nouice, &amp; braue ſpirit, bred and brought vp in the Ieſuits ſchoole, and that hath paſt and practiſed all their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall exerciſes, hath attained to that high perfection as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe nothing that is inioyned him, and in that holy obedience, hath ſtab'd ſome Heretike, or kil'd ſome great King, that would not ſtoope to the Vikar of Chriſt (as the <hi>Iacobine</hi> kil'd <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and the young Ieſuite had kil'd <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, but for a tooth, oh curſed tooth that hindered the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites from that honour, and made them leaue it for that baſe Frier and raskall <hi>Rauilliacke)</hi> When ſuch bleſſed occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſuch high and holy occaſions as theſe fall out (For theſe are occaſions beſeeming his Holineſſe) then hee will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to grace the pulpit, and in his owne perſon take paines to make a Sermon, ſometime bleſſing his gods of ſiluer and gold, and thanking his great god <hi>Dagon,</hi> ſometime prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Inuenters, Plotters and Proſecutors, but eſpecially the actors of ſuch noble facts, and ſtirring vp others to the admiration and imitation of them. And if the Heretikes bee ſo madde to deny this, that holy and zealous Sermon made by <hi>Sixtus V.</hi> vpon the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and in praiſe of that happy Frier that ſtab'd him with that holy and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>See the Sermon it ſelfe ſet out in lattin and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh by</hi> F. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mington <hi>the Prieſt.</hi>
               </note> hallowed knife, ſhall prooue and teſtifie it for euer to their ſhame, and his euerlaſting honour: And its not to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but if the Powder-plot in England had beene ſo happy to haue taken effect. His holineſſe would haue beene as willing to haue preached himſelfe for ioy, and made a Sermon of thankefulneſſe for the good ſucceſſe of ſo great and glorious a worke, as his ſucceſſors muſt bee ſerious and buſie and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in conceiling it from the ages to come, ſeeing it ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:14366:31"/> ceeded not, or in diuerting it from the Catholikes to Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans or other enemies. Or at leaſt in denying it, and telling the world that it was but an inuention, and a tricke of the State put vpon the poore Papiſts to make them odious. And herein appeares the malice of theſe Heretikes that care not how they ſclander the Popes holineſſe, ſaying, he neuer hath care, nor Conſcience to preach, when its moſt certaine, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Huguenot in France more deſired to go to a Sermon, nor a Puritane in England to a Faft then his Holineſſe did to haue preached vpon that occaſion, if hee could but once haue heard the ioyfull newes from England that the blow had beene giuen: But no matter what theſe blind and malitious Heretikes ſay or thinke, let it ſuffice God his heart, how earneſtly hee deſired it, and will doubtleſſe reward him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and all others that lookt and longed for that ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full day.</p>
            <p>And thus I hope wee haue giuen a ſufficient Apology for his Holineſſe againſt theſe curious and carping Heretikes. will you haue Maſſes? His Holineſſe miſſeth not a morning, but hath a Maſſe to his breakefaſt, will the Heretikes haue preaching? his Holineſſe preacheth alſo, when there falls out an occaſion that is worthy of his paines.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:14366:32"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Quae eſt Caput totius Orbis:</hi> And is the Church of Saint <hi>Iohn Lateran</hi> the principall and head of all Churches <hi>vrbis &amp; Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi> not of Rome alone but of the whole world: But why is not Saint <hi>Peters</hi> the head Church, ſeeing hee was the head of the Apoſtles, and the Pope is his ſucceſſor &amp; by being his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor is head of the Church: If <hi>Peter</hi> be head of the Apoſtles, and his ſucceſſor head of all men, why then is not his Church head of all Churches? Thus doe idle Heretikes carpe and cauill. But all good Catholikes know that ſeeing Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the eleuenth almoſt 300 yeares agoe eſtabliſhed it, and long after him <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, and after him <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth, by ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ſolemne Bulls confirmed it; therefore, no deuout Catholickes will once call it into queſtion. Indeed ſome in old time were ſo curious as to make doubt of it, but <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> therefore ſends out his Bull and ſtops their mouthes: And about the time of the Counſell of <hi>Trent</hi> the <hi>Benedictiue</hi> Monkes were ſo proud and pompous, as to ſtand vpon points with the Prebendaries or Chanons Regular of this Church of the <hi>Lateraene,</hi> and chalenge place and precedence afore them in the Counſell, (for many ſuch high points and mighty Church matters were debated in that Counſell) But what got they? <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth then Pope called the matter to his owne hearing, (ſhaming much that the world, and Heretikes eſpecially ſhould ſee two of his beſt ſons together by the eares <hi>which of them ſhould bee the greateſt,)</hi> and after long and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate hearing, iudgeth the matter for this Church, and impoſeth perpetuall ſilence to the Friers in this point: Yet afterward the Prebendaries or Prieſts of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> in the Vaticane, hoping that theſe conſtitutions concluded not them, out of their holy humility they alſo ſtroue with the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terane</hi> Clergy for precedence. So that <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> was faine to take the matter vpon hirs, and by a ſolemne and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocable decree, pronounced for the <hi>Laterane</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>Yet let not the deuout Catholicke thinke that his holineſſe neglects his Church of Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> For hee honours it with his preſence liuing and dead, more then any other, he keepes the bleſſed Iubile in it, and therefore he adornes it moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, and he is ſo carefull of it, that for the very repaire and fabricke of that one Church, hee hath ſcraped vp out of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome more then fiue hundreth thouſand pounds ſterling; and yet moſt wiſely hee keepes it vnfiniſhed, that ſo it may yet bring in more, for as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> being a fiſherman, yet catched but few fiſhes, but by the helpe of Chriſt caught many; So euen Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church by the helpe of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, brings good ſtore of fiſh to his Net, and thoſe as well
<pb facs="tcp:14366:33"/> great as ſmall: So true a fiſherman is Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor and ſo farre more skilfull then <hi>Peter</hi> was, that hee hath made the very name of Sant <hi>Peters</hi> Church bring him ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more gold and ſiluer then <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe got ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his fiſhing, or his preaching all his life long. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Peter</hi> at one Sermon caught three thouſand ſoules, and if any Lutheran aske when the Pope will doe ſo, anſwere them (like Heretikes as they bee) that <hi>Peter</hi> was made a fiſher of men, and therefore had nothing elſe to doe, but to labour to winne ſoules: But <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſors haue other kinde of imployment, they haue another kinde of fiſhing, and other kinde of fiſhes to fiſh for, they haue other, and higher, and better matters then winning of ſoules to looke to. For if they for theſe laſt thouſand yeares had found themſelues nothing elſe to doe, but to preach and winne ſoules, they had neuer brought it to this paſſe, to giue and take away King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Empires, to weare a triple Crowne, to bee caried on mens ſhoulders to haue Emperours hold his ſtirrop, powre his water, and bring vp his firſt diſh, and King to ſerue him at dinner, and many glorious matters more, whereof ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Saint <hi>Peter</hi> neuer once dreamed, and little thought hee (good man) when hee trudged vp and downe and preached, that his ſucceſſors could euer haue brought it to ſo faire a paſſe. But ſuch was the ſimplicity of thoſe, and ſuch is the wiſdome of theſe daies, that where Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſoules, now the very name of his Church ſhall bring in as much gold and ſiluer as will build good Churches: and as <hi>Peter</hi> at one Sermon tooke three thouſand ſoules, the Pope in holy imitation of him ſends out his Legates into ſeuerall nations, whereof one, in one City, by reading and caſting abroad one Bull of Indulgence from his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhall catch vp three thouſand, and three thouſand Crownes at a clappe, and all for the repayring of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church. And what though ſome, euen Catholickes are ſo curious as to cauill and ſay that not the tenth peny is beſtowed on the Church, nay what if not the hundreth part? muſt that offend a good Catholicke? As though the Pope hath not many other as good occaſions as that to beſtow it vpon: Hath not hee occaſion to ſend Royall Embaſſages, and to reward Ambaſſadors that come to him. Hath hee not his offices, his Guarde, his Garriſons to pay: to builde his Gallies, to vphold his armies, to maintaine his Minions, to aduance his Kinred, can theſe and many more as holy and good as theſe bee done with nothing?
<pb facs="tcp:14366:34"/> And therefore very requiſite that his Holineſſe haue good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lands, Dominions, Rents and reuenues, and the rather becauſe hee takes it not as his owne, but as Saint <hi>Peters</hi> patrimony and borrowes it from him, as the money that his officers ſweepe vp out of Chriſtendome, hee moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſaith, is not for himſelfe, but for the building and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church.</p>

                  <p>IN this Church of the <hi>Laterane</hi> there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Chappell which is called <hi>the Sacriſt,</hi> or the <hi>Veſtry:</hi> in it there is <hi>S. Iohns</hi> Altar <note n="12" place="margin">Here the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes may ſee how ancient Altars be, for as ſure as this is true, Altars bee as old as ſince S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt.</hi> Now whether this be that very Altar or no, &amp; whether thoſe vnder-named, be not the very Table that Chriſt ſupped at, and <hi>Moſes</hi> his rod, &amp; the right Arke of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, Heretickes will make queſtion, but good Catholicks will as firmely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it and more, then they will that the booke of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation</hi> is Canonical Scripture.</note> euen that very Altar which he had in the Wilderneſſe. And there is alſo that very Table vpon which Chriſt ſupped with his Diſciples at his laſt ſupper.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame place is the old Teſtament, to wit, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his rod, &amp; the Arke of the Couenant. All theſe did <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Veſpatian</hi> bring thither from <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> together with thoſe 4 great braſen pillars which now ſtand about the high Altar, within which Altar are the heads of the bleſſed
<pb facs="tcp:14366:16"/> Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi> And when theſe heads be ſhewed vnto the people, then there are as many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences at that Church as there bee at S. <hi>Peters</hi> Church <note n="13" place="margin">True, as many in the one place, as in the other.</note> at the ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Veronica.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo there is the Image or picture of our Lord, which was painted vpon the wall, not with mans hands, but by the Diuine worke of God, before all the people of <hi>Rome.</hi>

But they (poore ſoules) thinke that ſome of the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> made it ſecretly in the night, or ſome way elſe conueighed it thither. And thus they wilfully caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way themſelues, as though the holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would ſay this if it were not true.</note> And this Image thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared vpon the 5. day of the <hi>Ides</hi> of <hi>Nouember.</hi> Alſo there are the golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtickes that were in the firſt Tabernacle of the old Teſtament.</p>

                  <p>Likewiſe, there is that very linnen cloath or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well with which Chriſt wiped his Diſciples feet <note place="margin">(1) This fore-kin was miſſing many years, but it was found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine (ſaith <hi>Onuphri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us)</hi> ſuch good happe hath the holy <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that if any reliques be ſtolne or loſt, they are found againe in a ſhort time, ſome are ſo bold to ſay, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are put in their roomes, but they prate like Hereticks.</note> at his laſt ſupper.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skinne of Ieſus which was cut from him in his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion. (17)</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:14366:39"/>
                  <p>Alſo vpon euery firſt Sunday or Lords day of the Month of May, there is in the ſame Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of all ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe from the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of our Lord, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Kalends of Auguſt, there be for euery day, in that Church a thouſand yeares of pardon, and as many quarantens, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the third part of all a mans ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>And moreouer, all the yeare long, there is dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and for euery day ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and forty yeares of pardon, and as many qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantens.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore in the Church, there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Vault, or hollow paſſage vnder the earth, and it is called the Church-yard of Saint <hi>Calixtus</hi> the Pope: In this the holy Martires of God in times paſt vſed to hide themſelues, when they were perſecuted by the Romans: &amp; to this Vault
<pb facs="tcp:14366:40"/> there doe belong ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Indulgences and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons as none can number but onely God. <note n="2" place="margin">Seeing there belongs to that vault, ſo many Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, it ſeemes that our holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Abbots of England held vaults to be very holy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and therefore it was (doubtleſſe) that they made at ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Abbaies, vaults vnder the ground, leading from the Abbay to the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer very far off, that ſo the Nuns might meete the Friers &amp; get their part of theſe bleſſed Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences: Many of theſe holy vaults are yet to bee ſeene in England to the ſhame and confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts: And though thoſe vaults haue beene deerely loued of the Romiſh Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and ſo are ſtill where they yet be, and are therefore partakers of the Popes Indulgences, which made the Nunnes frequent them ſo willingly: yet was there one vault in England which was of greater value and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation then all theſe, and which (if the pouder there laid by thoſe deuout and zealous Catholickes had blowne vp the heretikes according to the minde and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of them that laid it, and the hope of his holineſſe, and the Ieſuites) ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely haue had as many bleſſings and Indulgences beſtowed on it, as the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe treaſure of the holy Roman Church could haue affoorded. But that worke was too good to proſper as ſome of themſelues ſaid, the day before they died.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo in the ſame Church there is the pit or hole, wherein the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> laie hid for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeares before they were found, and at this hole there are three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeares of pardon.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe in the ſame Church there is yet a pit or hole, ſcituate a little without the Church, and therein doe reſt the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of ſeauen and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Popes, euery one whereof graunted to this Church Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as great and ample as
<pb facs="tcp:14366:40"/> they could or might.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, there is in this Church as great and large Indulgence, as there is in the Church of <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle.</p>

                     <p>Likewiſe in ſame Church-yard of <hi>Calixtus,</hi> there is a certaine great ſtone, vpon which is drawne out the length of one of the nailes, with which <hi>Ieſus</hi> was nailed to the tree of the croſſe. <note n="4" place="margin">This was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a great naile, for out of one of them haue beene fince made at leaſt a thouſand more nailes, and which is more ſtrange, the firſt is ſtil as great as it was.</note>

                     <p>Alſo in the ſame Church there is the firſt altar that euer was made in the whole world.</p>
                     <p>Concerning which altar, thus it is ſaid that on a time <hi>Octauian</hi> the Emperour ſaw a Circle in the Heauens, and in
<pb facs="tcp:14366:55"/> the Circle the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and glorious Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi> ſtanding vpon an Altar, &amp; in her armes holding a childe: The Emperour amaſed at this ſight, heard a voice, that ſaid to him from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, <hi>This is the Altar of Heauen, of Gods Sonne. Octanian</hi> hearing this, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly fell downe vpon the earth, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Chriſt to come.</p>
                     <p>This viſion was ſeene in the chamber of <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uian</hi> the Emperour, and in that chamber he built the firſt Altar. <note n="24" place="margin">Muſt not this be an holy Altar that was made by ſo great a Saint as the Heathen Emperour <hi>Auguſtus?</hi> But if any aske how this can bee the firſt Altar, when as wee herd afore there is in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Church the Altar that Saint <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> ſaid Maſſe on in the wilderneſſe. Let not this trouble the good Catholike for is it not likely that Saint <hi>Octauian</hi> would ſend this his new made Altar to <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> from Rome? Yes verily as likely as that he made any.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>And at this Altar there is euery Sunday and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the aſſumption of our Lady the bleſſed Virgin, pardon and remiſſion of all ſinnes.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:14366:55"/>
                     <p>Alſo there is a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipfull Image of <hi>Mary</hi> the Virgin painted by the hands of bleſſed <hi>Luke:</hi> 
                        <note n="25" place="margin">See what good hap the holy Roman Church hath, that all the pictures ſhee hath of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> were drawne by the hands of Saint <hi>Luke</hi> himſelfe, but he forgot to tell vs this when hee wrote his Goſpell, or rather hee left it for the Pope to teach in aftertimes, when greater points are to bee reueiled then the Scripture teacheth, or then were fit for thoſe times.</note> which worſhipfull Image, whilſt bleſſed <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> caried in proceſſion with great ſolemnity, at that time when there was a horrible peſtilence in Rome (that it was called the great plague) as the proceſſion came neere the Caſtle of Saint An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gello, the Angell of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as often times before it had bowed it ſelfe to this venerable Image <note n="26" place="margin">
                           <p>Caluiniſts and Lutherans will not worſhip Images. But wee ſee here that the Image of marble did worſhippe the Image of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. Is it not ſtrange that a grauen Image ſhould bow to a painted Image? But ſuch and ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are the miracles in the holy Roman Church, and ſo deepe are the myſteries of her piety.</p>
                           <p>Away therfore to the fire with theſe curſed Heretiques that will worſhip no images: More hard hearted are they then the Marble Angell which full deuoutly bowed it ſelfe to the Venerable image. But no maruell though they be worſe then marble, when it is apparant (as the Ieſuites haue learnedly of late prooued from France) that they be worſe then the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell? For they deny purgatory, but the diuells confeſſe it; they ſay the Roman Church is not the true Church, but the diuells dare ſweare it by all the faith and truth that is in them: Nay they haue renounced God and their part in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, if the Roman Church bee not the true Church: So farre better are they then theſe Heretiques; And therefore it is great maruell that ſome nice Catholikes hold that wee may not equiuocate with theſe Heretiques, nor delude them, nor deceiue, nor oppreſſe them, but that it muſt bee called cruelty. For what can bee hard or ſharpe inough, towards ſuch beaſts as are worſe then diuells, and harder hearted then marble ſtones: or what good Catholickes care what they doe to ſuch baſe and vile Heretiques: who it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine are greater enemies to the Roman faith and Church, that now bee, then the diuell him: Let them therefore goe as they bee.</p>
                           <p>But whereas ſome tender hearted Catholikes, doe here make a queſtion how the marble Image was made ſtraight againe, when it had bowed it ſelfe, alaſſe that they ſhould bee ſo ſcrupulous, for could not the holy Image as eaſily reare vp it ſelfe againe as it bowed it ſelfe downe? Yes aſſuredly and I thinke the very Heretique will not deny it: Therefore that needes not to mooue you: But the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doubt I confeſſe is of more difficulty, namely that a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grauen Image ſhould bow to an Image that was but pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the Image of an Angell to the Image of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or to any but the Image of GOD.</p>
                           <p>This is certainely ſome great myſterie, I haue asked of the holy fathers and prieſts that come thither of it, but they anſwere mee diuerſely, and no maruell though the beſt wittes differ in ſo darke and difficult, and deepe a queſtion: Therefore the beſt aduiſe is that till his Holineſſe call ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Councell, if any man liſt to bee reſolued, Let him goe to Rome, and repaire to the Chaire that cannot erre: and beſides an infallible reſolution, hee may happily finde ſuch excellent inſtructors, and ſuch good examples there, as may make him, as deuout, as holy, as tender hearted, as is the marble Image that ſtands at the gate of the Caſtle of Saint Angell.</p>
